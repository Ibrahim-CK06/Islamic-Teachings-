    i hail from the Northern part of Ghana ,i dream of becoming a web developer in future
    and by the grace of the Almighty Allah,it will surely be done.This is my first ever website created,
    i got some help from AI but Insha'Allah,i will be creating one of my own from scratch with nobody helping me out. 
    I purposely created this website to aid people in the Qur'an recitation, and i also provide for you some duas that would aid you in your daily activities,
    at this juncture,i'd like to thank you for visting my website and may the almighty Allah bless you. Most importantly:PLEASE KEEP THE PEOPLE OF PALESTINE AND ANY OTHER WAR PLACES IN YOUR DUAS.'
